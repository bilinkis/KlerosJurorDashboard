# KlerosJurorsDashboard
This page lets you know your chances to be drawn as a Juror in a Kleros Court. It also shows you the evolution of cases, along with history of the Courts.

You can visit the dashboard in [klerosboard.com](klerosboard.com)

Please open an issue if you found any, or improvements feedbacks.

This Dashboard was inspired by the Kleroscan tool developed by Marc Zeller, visit his repo in [github](https://github.com/marczeller/Kleros-Monitor-Bot).

I would like to thank all the Kleros team for the support in the development, specially to William George who helps me with the mathematics.
